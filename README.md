# USVI Historic Explorer

USVI Historic Explorer is a simple React application that lists historic sites in the United States Virgin Islands. The project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for development and bundling. The app now includes a historic map view and a ride sharing utility.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
4. Build for production:
